        <h1><a href="/"><strong>Hop</strong></a> FAQ</h1>
		
		<h3><br/><strong>What should I buzz?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can buzz your selfies, your favorite TV shows, outfits, wonderful scenes, game screenshots, gossips, school life, relationship problems, funny moments and etc.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Who can see my buzzes?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can set your audience to friends, friends' friends, or everyone on Hop. Moreover, you can specify the gender of who can see your buzz.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Where are the hearts from?</strong></h3>
		<p>The hearts are from audience seeing you buzz, and you might get more hearts if you choose a larger audience base.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Do people received my buzz know who I am?</strong></h3>
		<p>Not if you don't post a selfie and say that's you. We do not show others your name or your profile photo when they see your buzz. We keep you anonymous when you buzz.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Can my mom know what I'm doing on Hop?</strong></h3>
		<p>No, all your buzzes are anonymous.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Why should I login with Facebook?</strong></h3>
		<p>Hop provides social features for you that you can start group chats and make friends with people with similar interests.  We hope all the users are people with real identities. That's why we ask you login with Facebook. However, we won't reveal your identity to others when you buzz.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I change my profile photo?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can change your profile photo by changing your Facebook profile photo. You have to restart Hop to apply the change. </p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I become Superstar on Hop?</strong></h3>
		<p>Superstars are people who got most hearts on the previous day. To become a superstar, you can set your audience to everyone on Hop and try to buzz more to get more hearts. Also, you can try to buzz something that your friends would  like.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Why do I receive only few buzzes?</strong></h3>
		<p>If you have no Hop friends and there is no one to buzz to everyone on Hop, you won't get any buzz. You can wait for notifications of buzzes (please turn on the notification of Hop) or just ask your best friends to join Hop!</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>Why do I always miss the buzzes?</strong></h3>
		<p>A buzz only lives for 30 seconds, so you may be too late sometimes. If you always miss the buzzes, please check if you Turned on "Set Automatically" in Settings > General > Date & Time.</p> 
		
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I start a live group chat?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can start a group chat by buzzing. Hop will bring people who like your buzz most to the group chat.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I join a live group chat?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can join a group chat by giving many hearts to a buzz and you can chat with the original poster and other biggest fans to the buzz.</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I become a biggest fan of a buzz instead of being a watcher or not invited?</strong></h3>
		<p>Give more hearts to the buzz ! People who give most hearts to a buzz will become biggest fans and can chat with the original poster. People who give less heart than biggest fans will become watchers that can watch the live group chat and give hearts to nice replies in the group chat. However, the number of biggest fans and watchers of a buzz is limited. Give more hearts as you can !  </p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I add friends on Hop?</strong></h3>
		<ul>
			<li>Adding real life friends: your real life friends can add you by scanning your Hop code at the second tab, and encourage you to share your hop code to your social networks to get more funny buzzes around your social circles.</li>
			<li>Making new friends in group chat: you can make new friends by giving hearts and joining the group chats. You can send a friend request by tapping one's big photo at the top.</li>
			<li>Adding superstars: you can add the superstars directly on the news feed.</li>
			<li>Adding random friends: you can screenshot the Hop code and buzz it to see who will add you back.</li>
		</ul>
		<h3><br/><strong>What can Hop coins do?</strong></h3>
		<p>It is a secret for now! We are planning to let you use Hop coins to buy something like Snapchat replay and oh I cannot tell you more now ...</p>
		<h3><br/><strong>How do I give feedbacks?</strong></h3>
		<p>You can go to the last tab and find feedback function under "more"; or if you want to send an anonymous feedback, you can go to the chat tab, tap Hop bot, and send your feedback to it. We take your feedback seriously.</p>
